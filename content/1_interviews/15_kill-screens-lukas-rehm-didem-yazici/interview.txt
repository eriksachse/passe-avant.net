You have a theoretical and practical background: art history and theatre studies in Munich and media art in Karlsruhe. One can see this multi-disciplinary base clearly in your work. For example, you are not only interested in the relationship between form and content, but in its display. You are producing the sound of your video works and collaborating in performance and theatre pieces. What does it mean to you to work cross-disciplinary and how does it influence your practice?"},"id":"ba8d7264-6c03-4638-aaf9-d3241f058d9e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<strong>Lukas Rehm <\/strong>I\u2019m driven by the search for conditions of resonance. The multiplicity of mediums I address in my work might have a somewhat eclectic appeal, yet there is a bedrock interest in abrasions and concurrence. I try to find patterns of argumentation, referential nodes, musical or spatial arrangements that intersect and simultaneously cause friction: similitudes without congruence. I believe this liminal asymmetry \u2013 causing a resonance \u2013 is what draws me to art in diverse forms and modes. It\u2019s a fundamental drive for artistic collaboration in theatre or opera for example, but any artistic experience is produced in a multitude with projected and active viewers. I guess this aspect of an involved audience also informs the installative character of the works I come up with \u2013 an inclusive, yet not innocent stage."},"id":"6cb8abf8-4376-43ab-9cc6-0b85b09a5ba2","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<strong>DY <\/strong>You recently won the Emerging Artist Prize 2019 of Rainer Wild Art Foundation and had a solo exhibition at Kunsthalle Baden-Baden\u2019s one-room exhibition space, \u201845cbm\u2019 (until 12 January 2020). On the occasion of this exhibition, you made a new video installation <em>Kill Screens: A Much More Elaborate and Attractive New Set of Toys<\/em> (2019). This multi-layered work deals with questions around new technologies, psychology, game design and politics.

Some of the displays are only partly broken and show a fragmentary image; all their speakers still work. Most of them are results of \u201crage quits\u201d. That means they were destroyed in a brief moment of frustration triggered by a video game or perhaps a TV sports broadcast. I\u2019ve become interested in working with these technological artefacts as they condense issues that appear quite exemplary to this decade: frustration, agitation, ecological and economical (auto-)aggressive behaviour, fatalism. Trump, Bolzonaro, Johnson, Duderte, H\u00f6cke, Strache. New communication mediums are again being successfully exploited by political instigators: on the one hand they are speaking to people frustrated by complexity, that includes finding arrangements with otherness, inequality and social acknowledgement. On the other hand, they frustrate and paralyze their political opponents by the mere scope of politically incorrect actions, demanding reactions."},"id":"28fd5a4a-3e67-4a9e-875a-cf49737aeda6","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_rz1a1774michellemantel_lukasrehm.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Lukas Rehm, 'Kill Screens.

He aimed to join the online ranks of white supremacist spree killers and published a \u201cmanifesto\u201d which reads like a gaming instruction, including achievements with titles derogatory to minorities in the West. He killed two Germans who posed no threat to him and uttered statements of self-hate and weariness of life.

In <em>Kill Screens<\/em> I also address the so-called Iowa Study which linked frustration and regression, arguing that in stress situations we fall back into earlier states of social development and act \u201cchildlike\u201d. Destructive behaviour generates a temporary superiority, disregarding consequential social sanctions, personal material loss or ecological aftermath. Organized hate speech or hate crimes on the one hand, the destruction of interfaces \u2013 the screen \u2013 on the other. Brief satisfactory acts of regaining sovereignty.

In the third phase, a barrier divided the room and the child was only left with the crayons in one part while it could see all other toys through the fence. This resulted in verbal attacks against the present experimenters as well as physical attacks against the barrier. There was also a post-frustration period where the kid was allowed to play with all toys again. The interesting aspect of the experiment, however, was of course the hypothesis that frustration triggers regression and can result in fatalistic behaviour. The spatial and dramaturgical structure of the experiment became the basis for the work. The layout of the screens and the position of a physical barrier in the exhibition space derive from the experiment\u2019s blueprints. I also rebuilt the experiment in a game engine with a mix of originally described toys and actualized objects of desire that are shown on the screens in form of a captured walkthrough the scene with interactions."},"id":"a95ed41d-a7c7-4db3-82c7-0bf623d47829","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_rz1a1928michellemantel_lukasrehm_2.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Lukas Rehm, 'Kill Screens.

Niklas Luhman was describing a religious perfervour emitting the screen. Indeed, this active light and content source has an inescapable attraction and its promise of satisfaction through a stream of novelties and recognition has been a constant that product manufacturers, advertisers and artists make use of alike. Consequently, the destroyed screen carries the fatality of an (involuntary) iconoclasm. Each of the screens in the exhibition has a story I was told while picking them up from the families and couples that offered them online. During the process of testing the arrangement in my studio I decided to accentuate this relationship between emitter and the spectator by darkening the room and even killing the floor reflections in the inaccessible part of the room with a black carpet."},"id":"94692948-ce3b-4f7d-bfed-629724bc00f4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_rz1a1768michellemantel_lukasrehm.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Lukas Rehm, 'Kill Screens.

They\u2019re not only structurally interesting since they often have to adapt to the mechanisms of the game play, but they are also hotbeds for referential interplay and experimental aesthetics in a huge market. Growing up I\u2019ve reencountered the music by Amon Tobin with whom I\u2019ve been subconsciously familiar through playing the <em>Splinter Cell<\/em> series and whose tracks were later used in choreographies by Pina Bausch. For the installation, I\u2019ve addressed this interest by listening to different soundtracks e.g. to <em>Dark Souls 3 <\/em>which is infamous for its difficulty, hence prompting many rages quits. I\u2019ve composed a polyphonic vocal lamento resembling Early Music but with a libretto based on the earlier mentioned references of the work. They were beautifully interpreted by tenor Han Sol Choi and formed the first part of the work\u2019s soundtrack. The second half then transitions via a digitally designed and cinematic segment towards a climax including a heavy guitar recording comparable to the <em>DOOM<\/em> soundtrack. At the end, all previous elements re-enter and disassemble. I\u2019ve structured the arch similar to the psychological curve of a rage quit with frustration build-up, a fatal discharge and a period of realization or forced repose."},"id":"6236c45e-51da-4145-8db0-b4ab68fa145e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_rz1a1833michellemantel_lukasrehm.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Lukas Rehm, 'Kill Screens.
