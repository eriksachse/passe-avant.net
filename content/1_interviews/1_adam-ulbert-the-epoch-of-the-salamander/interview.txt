I think whenever we talk about symbols, we are already distancing things from each other. The enlightened scientific approach is detaching itself from objects in order to justify utilising them without respect and care. Symbolism might be a remorse for all the dissection Western science did. But if you want to approach things, any sort, from an alchemical point of view you have to immerse yourself in the matter which is not dead.

Softening the edges of storytelling is something I\u2019m heading towards with this booklet of the salamander\u2019s monologue.
