Though modernity conceptualized it as a tool for understanding, I think it is also more of an ontological paste or lubricant. It is there, acting without our realisation.

I think whenever we talk about symbols, we are already distancing things from each other. The enlightened scientific approach is detaching itself from objects in order to justify utilising them without respect and care. Symbolism might be a remorse for all the dissection Western science did. But if you want to approach things, any sort, from an alchemical point of view you have to immerse yourself in the matter which is not dead.

It is a matter of humility and sensitivity how one utilises it to articulate something hopefully valid in the present moment. If we consider capitalism as something that is the embodiment of the human drive \u2013 psychologically and metabolically too \u2013 then it is understandable that we want to overexploit and re-utilise it again and again. It is also a matter of systemic awareness, which doesn\u2019t happen without self-awareness, I\u2019m afraid.",

By this method, I could gain some distance from the works as auteur.
