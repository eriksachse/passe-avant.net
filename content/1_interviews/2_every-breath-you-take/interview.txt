The audience was invited to join after the ritual, to feel and touch, move around the sculptures, write on the tiles of the well. A performer was singing and stepping on one of the floorboards to produce sound. Another musician had attached contact microphones to the metal door at the back, so the sound then resonated in the atmosphere. Together with another drumming from the walls of the boat, two violinists and a clarinet awoke the silence with their melodies. The performance was transcending from calm and collected to chaos, panic, almost violence. Then it stopped and finished with a slow, more hopeful ending. Then, rapping and singing started, performers were reading through the song, holding sheets of paper, basically playing the ship, shouting, stopping, singing again. It was really dramatic. Everything was very touching. A few people cried. I was hoping for people to feel emotional and irritated, transcending into different states of emotions."},"id":"04d7ffc4-dd5b-4a22-9c07-5295c98d56ba","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<em>[Heroin by Velvet Underground playing]<\/em>"},"id":"1dc459ce-f3f7-43d9-9b85-6e7b1074d21d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<strong>LG <\/strong>Irritation was something that I noticed, too, especially when it comes to certain lighting choices you made.

Linda Toivio, the curator, and I talked for ages about how to install the works. We had scaffoldings we could use, but at first, we thought that they would be too prominent; but wires across the top of the boat would have sunken. So, with the help of my partner, we created a construction attached to the outside of the boat. It was so much effort to produce this exhibition. Everything is hand-made, even the whole framework support. The raw silk, for example, was dyed at Grabowsee, where I organise a residency, by boiling it with different herbs or food-remains from the communal kitchen. The medicinal plants in the exhibition are collected and dried me, too. I had to make moulds for the latex, then the tiles\u2026Oh my God, I hate tiling. But that was something new I introduced. When I was in London doing my MA at Chelsea College of Arts, I was working with ceramic, in particular, porcelain. I developed a way to use porcelain to represent bones in the form of broken chains, that link works together and act as a fragile support for everything \u2013 a combination of fragile\/strong. In the same way, the tiles replaced this element and I used them for this exhibition as leverage, like a support for everything else. I collected the tiles from Grabowsee, and constructed the wooden structure holding them. The hand-made aspect to the works is really important, because it brings a craft element, which is apparent in all my recent work."},"id":"4eaabb5e-a90c-4b35-a247-997bd22cf70b","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["alice_hosek_09_20-10.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Photograph: Juan J.

That is why we decided for this particular concept of the exhibition \u2013 it felt necessary for both of us. And in this sense, as an example, I don\u2019t feel that \u2018feminism\u2019 is working, because why is it then that I keep meeting identified women who have been in similar situations and they don\u2019t feel like they have a voice or are made to feel that their sensitivity towards certain things is a weakness. That they have to sort themselves out, going to endless therapy sessions, and working on self-healing to \u2018fit in\u2019. It feels like \u2018erratic\u2019 emotions are still conditioned by society. You start to question yourself and feel manipulated by a \u2018male\u2019 voice. As long as everything is conditioned in a patriarchal system, and women are conditioned to think in a certain way, we won\u2019t ever go beyond that. I think it\u2019s really problematic. I\u2019m not saying that there aren\u2019t and haven\u2019t been discourses challenging this, I just feel, in my experience in everyday life, I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of things don\u2019t change. For me it\u2019s hard to articulate these things, it is a really big and complicated, layered topic. It is also not a new one. There is also a lot to talk about in terms of gender and people in society who are discriminated because of this. I produce the works instinctively while thinking about these issues a lot at the moment, and much more during lockdown; The roles of gender and the expectations of society concerning this. I\u2019ve been reading more feminist literature, especially Black feminism, one example is \u2018Your silence with not protect you\u2019 by Audre Lorde. I have fallen in love with the way she writes and her poetry. I want to think more about my role as a woman in the art world, I want to express more about that, not just for myself but also for other women. It comes from a very personal tone in situations I have felt very vulnerable as a woman, and I know that I am not alone. But on the other hand, I find it hard to be so heavy or political with my exhibitions, because I work intuitively. Therefore, I aim to be poetic, playful, and uncanny. If only some people notice, it is okay; to appreciate the work you don\u2019t need to know all of this. It\u2019s there to bring a feeling and raise questions."},"id":"8acc7307-257c-4beb-93a8-d95c90829191","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["juan-j.-juste-del-valle_8.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Alice Morey, 'Every Breath You Take', 2020, exhibition view.

I feel it goes deeper than this specific show. I feel we live in these paradoxical situations where we are, for example, sad to be happy, some things taste good or they taste bad, something to counteract what it means to feel good. Violence can be many things. In this show, I am obviously using violence from this abuse, using the song to hold it together. The song came to me intuitively\u2026 as songs sometimes do. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with this love song after I broke up with my boyfriend. But recently, with maturity, after reading the lyrics, I realised it\u2019s a really fucked-up song. I also connected it with the times we are living in, this desperation of life, of existing, of being in the world. I think it\u2019s really relevant today \u2013 with the pandemic, everyone thinks more about what life really means, like the appreciation of the cycles of life and nature. So, going back to this violence, I feel like violence can be in many forms. Not just a physical thing."},"id":"1a643023-cf56-4713-a44c-77b061f8b959","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<strong>LG <\/strong>The title of your exhibition indirectly mentions meditation and mindfulness, where breathing is central.

There are many layers to it, but I feel this mindfulness, that utopic happiness is just an illusion. So, violence is a topic I am working on at the moment, in its destruction. In the same way, I\u2019ve been interested in decay, and the way things form, evolve and go in and out of each other, and how you can\u2019t stop this. It\u2019s always about evolution and ecology. I think violence has a lot to play in that.
