Preview: The London and Basel-based artist Sophie Jung works across performance, sculpture and text. Recent projects include a series of live performances during Frieze London 2019, the solo exhibition ‘The Bigger Sleep’ at Kunstmuseum Basel and the installative performance The Day Teaches The Day at Cabaret Voltaire in Zurich. Her latest solo exhibition ‘They Might Stay the Night’ at Casino Luxembourg, which consists of a “coalition” of sculptures, had to close temporarily due to the Corona pandemic. When Sophie and our author Louisa Behr talked on the phone about the interview, they quickly came to the conclusion that they didn’t want to discuss primarily how her projects and artistic practice are affected by the pandemic. We’re still in the middle of it, so we can’t put the effects into words yet. Rather, the crisis gave us an impulse to talk generally about temporality, materiality and presence within performative and sculptural work and to examine their virtual potentials.

With those pieces the sort of inherent logic, their inter-active subcognitive sense-making and also the sensuality of the sculptures in formal solidarity within and amongst each other comes first before any form of pronounceable content is worked into or out of them. In these situations and performances, I react to a collective of assemblages that came into being through compositional and improvised affective processes. Their making is an exploration, it discovers, or even forms an abundance of thought rather than having to react to, translate or represent them.

It\u2019s important to me that it\u2019s a multi-step process, that singular meaning or content isn\u2019t inherently built into the piece, isn\u2019t exchangeable or equitable, but that it softly lands, as a transparent veil, woven of deviant strands.

A prop is denied an existence as the thing itself but serves as a sort of shadow representation of an idea, a narrative thread. Funnily enough, I would say that that\u2019s the way we, in the western tradition, are taught to experience art. We learn to see it as a prop, i.e. to replace what there is, an unruly, untameable, powerfully irreducible material entity, with the clean and tidy sense we\u2019ve made of it, either as storyteller, embodiment of historical narratives or concept-bearer. We figure it out (of any agency) and my aim is to transcend the binary tool and considerable aesthetic object, the ready-at-hand and present-to-hand. The sculptures I make are made up of a plurality of objects which come from a variety of contexts and therefore come with different histories, timelines, textures and densities. They are already not only one idea of one object, they are already very paradoxical within themselves. They have different aims and means and reasons for being in this world. Parts of them were either produced to serve: an object of utility; or to please and distract: a decorative item. In a capitalist society there is little imagination for alternative object-production. As sculptural assemblage they get to shed themselves off their duties and can form new allegiances, generate new identities. Within the performance, I sometimes address them in their potential to serve or to please, but always from idiosyncratic angles, and often the wrong way around."},"id":"d5db4ff0-2d8f-4b38-abcb-09f94a41c86d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"I very strongly feel that objects as classic metaphors are a waste of space and extremely disrespectful towards the object. But at the same time, you cannot deny a reader a certain element of legibility. They will read, whether you want them to read or not. So, when the sculptures are shown as an exhibition, they are understood in their entirety and in their complexity and then they\u2019re also silent and withdrawn. And when they\u2019re used as props, they begin to speak but they also disappear out of their materiality because the idea or the narrative is foregrounded, and they become tools. So, for me, I want them to be both, withdrawing autonomously into their complex assemblage of auras and at the same time to tease us with their remnants of tool-ness."},"id":"a3a7ce0f-2bab-4cb9-b300-64ee639ccc6f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<strong>LB<\/strong> I really enjoyed your installation at Kunstmuseum Basel.

As in a small theatre company that wants to produce a multi-character classic, each item had to take on several roles. A metal wire construction served as cloud, as bar, as soup kitchen and as rattle, a metal bench press was turned around to play Pegasus, its fist of feathers a brief revolution when the black table legs on top of each other became Marie Antoinette\u2019s window, turned around into a guillotine, the <em>Millennium Falcon<\/em> became a waffle iron to feed the audience waffle, a rusty military ladle went from that to a chic hat to a clock-tower bell, a reproduction of the Parthenon frieze became a lyre \/ a liar and made my butler freeze \/ frieze and so on. This was the most theatrical piece yet, when I use the sculptures as text-triggers they are equally addressed in a plurality of functions, but more in a subtly and literary fashion. I suppose using them for several things makes them slippery, introduces the untameable potential that they do still have so it leaves them their autonomy in that way. They briefly lend themselves to me in one of their many incarnations, but they don\u2019t enslave themselves to me. It\u2019s funny, my current show has neither text nor performance, yet somebody said to me they feel like they are walking through a constantly morphing stage set for a multitude of overlapping plays."},"id":"4ed2ad3f-f0d9-4345-958e-7b609b4601b1","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_installationsansicht-_the-bigger-sleep.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Sophie Jung, <em>The Bigger Sleep<\/em>, 2018, installation view, Kunstmuseum Basel.

The idea of the object versus the object itself. The idea being its essence and that essence always being somewhere else, so the materiality of an object is always a placeholder of its essence, which is the idea which transcends etc. but I think I kind of come from the other direction and I look at an object\u2019s direct presence, its plurality of manifest presences, so that\u2019s much more the materialist logic, which I think is a lot more respectful of the object in its autonomy while considering the many forces that brought it into existence and the speculative fabulations that carry it further. To be honest, I would actually like to steer these conversations away from the old thinkers that everybody constantly has to refer to in order to say something new. I think we can say something new without referring to them.

As a body encountering a sculpture you raise a question to that piece and vice versa and something happens in-between. This experience is much more visceral and affective than images could ever describe. When you look at an image, you\u2019re in a position of analysis, of consumption.

To me a live performance only makes sense when you can encounter a live audience directly and physically \u2013 it\u2019s a conversation. In theatre, even if the fourth wall is partially broken the lights are still so bright that the performers cannot see the audience and in a lot of contemporary theatre, they don\u2019t veer from their learned lines.

In theatre, you speak<em> at <\/em>the audience and in performance, you speak <em>with<\/em> the audience.

Its constitution in time and space is less precarious, as an audience you have a less responsible yet possibly more intimate focus.

Every time the work is seen, it can be structurally different, not as a performance repeated over a few evenings, but it is intensively different."},"id":"d336d4e0-86b0-4e0c-83e0-d3db52584637","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_installationsansicht-_the-bigger-sleep_-1.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Sophie Jung, <em>They might stay the night,<\/em> 2020, installation view, Casino Luxembourg.

I think we\u2019re all a little bit stuck in our practice as we\u2019re used to producing and relying on our style or our projected audience-expectations. We hardly ever question why it is that we do what we do. What urgency or what curiosity these pieces we churn out come from. What they embody and if their embodiment is still a sincere expression, if we still dig deep and if we dig in the right place. So, I think that with the sort of silence and this enforced solitude around us, this is a good moment to re-question our motivations and the different forces that are in our work \u2013 if we\u2019re actually still okay with them or if we wanted it to exert its power somewhere else maybe. I live-react a lot while teaching and usually structure the course loosely and edit it from day to day based on needs and wishes, so preparing for a less animated and less flexible classroom was very difficult. It\u2019s really hard to get into a flurry of dense critical thinking when mics have to be switched on and off and cameras aren\u2019t working and it\u2019s harder to gauge the level of engagement and interest but we\u2019re doing our best. I think the students are really working very hard at engaging within this extremely difficult scenario. And, lastly, in reminiscence of your first question around institutional critique, I truly love the fact that this way of encountering each other allows for a bit more sneaky context, I welcome the collages of individual conditions that become visible, not for the sake of voyeuring, but because it disrupts any perceived classroom homogeneity or any false sense of \u2018we\u2019. We are plural, we are different, our backgrounds differ and yet we can find a collective voice, and yet we can communicate."},"id":"3537802d-8080-4714-95e5-e93c6209ceaa","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"<strong>LB <\/strong>What a good way to close the conversation!
