My grandpa was in the hospital then in critical condition, on the verge of crossing over. The idea of leaving the planet, or the planet leaving you, was constantly on my mind. Sometimes I would look up and imagine the sky emptying, clouds breaking in crumbs. One such morning, as my aunt was driving us back from breakfast on her motorbike, we stopped by a family-run photography business. She was picking up an order she placed, digital prints of my grandpa for his ancestral altar. A pre-emptive errand. She slipped the photos into a bag and through the plastic\u2019s sheer crinkles I looked at him. Tones pinked, lines softened. He looked spotless and innocent. An apparition against the white background, the photo like an angel\u2019s passport."},"id":"6f8dd8fc-d0b6-4927-95e0-0a6cd8770286","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_a-situation_1.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi, \u2018<em>Between A Planet and A Wound<\/em>\u2019, 2019, installation view, Atletika, Vilnius.

I learned this from my mother, a masterful tailor. She must have known this fact texturally, could intuit the gauzy fabric on her fingertips. She emphasized that mourning garments are unhemmed but ripped and I imagined cloth shredded raw in the hands of a mourner. People used to wear ripped muslin as a headscarf for three years after the death of a loved one. For the three years you wore that headscarf you also kept your mournful piety. No kissing, no courtship, no decadence. Today\u2019s modern people, she told me, decided that\u2019s way too long a time for anything, including mourn, so now we burn the muslin day-of."},"id":"67b0f2e6-47b6-4608-9487-f2d5f6b400fe","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Some families only burn muslins for those present at the funeral, fearing that burning extra will send another soul to cross over. Some burn pieces for every member, wherever they may be on earth in that moment. Last summer when my grandma on my dad\u2019s side passed, my parents attended the funeral in Saigon.

In the worship tradition of <em>c\u00fang<\/em>, where we tend to ancestors by cleaning their altars, cooking for them and lighting them incense, we do so to keep them alive. We rebel against fate as given. We collage, rather than draw lines between, presence and absence, life and death, <em>then<\/em> and <em>now<\/em>. In <em>Syncrisis<\/em> you return to scenes that haunt our collective retinas, like the self-immolation of Thich Quang \u0110uc; you mix the recording of the burning with a scene where your father describes seeing it with his own eyes, and one from Ingmar Bergman\u2019s <em>Persona <\/em>where the main character Elisabeth watches the recording on television. Like <em>c\u00fang<\/em>, or what Trinh T. Minh-ha terms \u201crelation to infinity\u201d for uniting different situations in cinema, in these acts you are dissolving divisions between space and time."},"id":"5af9ca8c-295d-4bb2-b153-d492147fc968","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Like the solar sail in your exhibition, my feelings about the power of images sway. When I last wrote you I was skeptical, now I\u2019m billowed toward them. Your film is reflected on both sides of it, connecting the relationship between solar sails and the moving image, respectively affected by light particles. The Soviet biophysicist Alexander Chizhevsky traced the historical correlation between solar cycles and human behavior: minimal solar activity corresponded with peacefulness, its increase with social unrest. The airflow of the exhibition space gently undulated your sail. Through Chizhevsky\u2019s reading, the sail modelled our collective life-force."},"id":"fc9261f0-b5e6-4824-b452-abacda1b7351","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_a-situation_2.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi, \u2018<em>Between A Planet and A Wound<\/em>\u2019, 2019, installation view, Atletika, Vilnius.

While you were working on <em>Syncrisis<\/em>, you got in a major car accident. While laying in the hospital you filmed yourself\u2014your eye, your body. There\u2019s a part in <em>The In\/Extinguishable Fire<\/em> that\u2019s a close-up of the wound of your knee. It\u2019s indiscernible as a knee and becomes a narcotic blurred mass. In an email you described the scene as \u201can oscillation between a planet and a wound.\u201d I loved that.

Her work explores imaginations of freedom at the intersection of film-making and film theory, critical refugee studies and postcolonial studies, personal\/prosthetic memory and individual\/collective histories. Nguyen-Chi studied Fine Arts at St\u00e4delschule (class of Simon Starling and Peter Fischli, 2010-2015) and Film at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (2017-2019). In September 2020, Nguyen-Chi will begin pursuing PhD research in Film at the University of Westminster. She has previously exhibited and screened her work at Atletika, Vilnius; Centro di Musica Contemporanea di Milano, Milan; Gene Siskel Film Center, Chicago; Kunstverein N\u00fcrnberg, N\u00fcrnberg; Museum f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt; Nottingham Contemporary, Nottingham; Portikus, Frankfurt; S\u00e0n Art, Saigon \/ New Museum, New York \/ NTC Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore, Singapore; Site Galleries, Chicago; University of Bonn, Bonn, among other venues.<\/em>"},"id":"d2a295b1-6502-4924-8834-9ab7598688b4","isHidden":false,"type":"text"}]
