Title: A Carpet for Your Somersaults

Subtitle: Juliette Blightman

Place: Galerie Fons Welters, Amsterdam

Preview: Thinking inwards, I remember the trampoline had green tape on it. I saw it in the dark, it was raining.Now in the film I see the tape to be white and black. After 12 seconds of a dark screen the trampoline appears amidst summer foliage. Black bars, black net, white clusters of tape on both, the part that one actually jumps on is black with a dark teal skirting, a grey metal structure and a rusty ladder are peaking out.
