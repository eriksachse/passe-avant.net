Place: Damien & The Love Guru, Brussels

Preview: 17,000 years ago, a number of holes were made in the walls of the caves of Lascaux, in the South of France. Branches were stuck in the holes, serving as stable horizontal beams. Vertical beams were then attached, creating a structure that gave access to the ceiling. This is how the Lascaux caves were painted.

Branches were stuck in the holes, serving as stable horizontal beams. Vertical beams were then attached, creating a structure that gave access to the ceiling. This is how the Lascaux caves were painted. The ancient Greeks built scaffolds to make statues, larger than life. In the Altes Museum in Berlin there is a drinking cup from the early 5th century BC. The \u2018Berlin Foundry Cup\u2019 is painted all around with images of an ancient Greek foundry. Sculptors work on one of the statues, standing on a wooden scaffold. We use metal scaffolds to construct our buildings. They were developed by two English brothers called Daniel and David Jones. In 1913, they built a scaffold around Buckingham Palace using their patented system, \u2018Rapid Scaffixers\u2019, to fit the metal tubes together. Their scaffolding promised change, promised progress, and stood in the way of an unobstructed view on development."},"id":"688e9c20-ab5a-41c4-a31b-cec5ca2ed555","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"There\u2019s no such history written of safety mesh, the netting that contemporary scaffolds are often wrapped in. Fa\u00e7ades are wrapped in scaffolds are wrapped in mesh. The veils that shroud the work of construction in mystery. Mesh tries to cancel the scaffold\u2019s promise, to make it disappear before the work is even done. All it wants us to have is the grand reveal. It renders almost invisible and harmless the messiness of construction. Almost. Mesh is not transparent, but it\u2019s also not opaque. It\u2019s a web that places itself between us and an object and makes us look at both, simultaneously. We see the building behind the scaffold\u2019s sharp lines through the mesh; the veil and its objects becoming one."},"id":"0645ea35-02eb-469e-99e0-606994a68a37","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_13.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Jasmin Werner, <em>Fa\u00e7adomy (Compa\u00f1\u00eda Sudamericana de Vapores Valparaiso, Chile), <\/em>2020, printed mesh fencing, aluminium, zip ties, thread, 32 x 20 x 58 cm.

Crape was a matte gauze made of waste silk, crimped with heated rollers, then dyed black and stiffened with starch or glue. Strict mourning etiquette forbade all colors but black and dictated widows to wear crape veils over their faces whenever in public, for up to four years after their husbands had passed away. For the prescribed duration of the process of mourning, the widow had no choice but to present herself to the outside world as a colorless image reminiscent of the past. Like a classical fa\u00e7ade against a rapidly modernizing backdrop, she stood out from her surroundings, performing an apparent nostalgia for times since gone."},"id":"8a9d8f19-8a29-4d67-8637-ead3aa09879e","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Some women called crape \u2018a veritable instrument of torture\u2019 because, apart from this emotional labor, it was costly, kind of heavy and unpleasant. It caused irritation to the eyes and skin and stained the face when wet or damp. \u201cMany a woman has been laid in her coffin by the wearing of crape,\u201d a doctor wrote by the end of the 19th century. It\u2019s true that inhaling its poisonous particles was known to have caused death. But despite all this, the obscuring mesh supposedly served a noble cause: to protect the widow against \u201cthe untimely gayety of a passing stranger.\u201d"},"id":"a00b5fa1-b8ea-42cf-b1a5-0962f5167cdb","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_19.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Jasmin Werner, <em>Fa\u00e7adomy (Dom R\u00f6mer, Frankfurt), <\/em>2020, printed mesh fencing, aluminium, zip ties, thread, synthetic hair, 32 x 20 x 59 cm.
