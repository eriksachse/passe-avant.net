Preview: For PASSE-AVANT the authors Luisa Del Prete, Naomi Rado and Demba Sanoh wrote an article about the current debate on the presentation of a racist painting by Georg Herold. In their text, which is accompanied by comments from James Gregory Atkinson, Nicholas Grafia and Genevi√®ve Lassey, they reveal the extent to which this is not an isolated case in German museums and what it means to assume responsibility as an institution.

As a society, this is a question we must ask ourselves again and again\u201d is the beginning of the statement by the social media department of Frankfurt's St\u00e4del Museum, which reached various Instagram users via private message on 22 June 2020. The compact text was sent out in response to the numerous and critically connoted reposts concerning a painting by Georg Herold from 1981 \u2013 along with its accompanied label and with an emphasis on its title \u2013 that is currently on show at the St\u00e4del. [1] The painting, measuring 90 x 130 centimetres in landscape format, is quite large, but deliberately neither named nor depicted in this text."},"id":"fcbb6e6d-1c20-4a3f-943a-668503c3970a","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"The painting on hardboard is characterized by its expressive style and is almost entirely covered in a strong yellow, partly mixed with white, party applied in its primary tone. Yellow is also the dominating colour of the left background, where the head of the most prominent figure is placed. Parts of its head are yellow too while the rest of its body is painted in dark rose and violet. In any case, the body of the described male figure is clearly darker than the skin of its opponents that are shown in the lower-right edge of the picture. The facial expressions of the other figures are only vaguely visible in black contour lines in a complementary pastel green tone. Their gestures, however, are more decisive: one hand seems to grasp the figure on the left by the arm, another hand stretches far upwards. It is probably this hand that threw the brick that seems to fly towards the large figure in the middle of the picture. A traffic light separates the pack from the individual \u2013 whose distinguishing features unmistakably suggest a racist stereotype \u2013 and gives green light for the brick to be thrown."},"id":"78b205f3-985d-4c4c-9e9e-3b2c5ae0bd9f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"The statement continues: \u201cWe as a museum see ourselves as a place of freedom, debate and contradiction. [...] We want to look with our visitors, not look away. We are sorry if the text accompanying the work is not clear enough in its anti-racist interpretation.\u201d While one would not want to accuse the St\u00e4del of having any racist intention per se, one should take a firm and analytical look at the question of what is actually problematic about this work and the circumstances of its presentation; the debate certainly does not only concern the stereotypical depiction of a Black person, let alone the text accompanying the work. The problem lies deeper and must be grasped at its structural level. The criticism is less directed at Georg Herold as a person, even if one could certainly ask what the artist\u2019s intention is in using this very motif. However, the artist\u2019s intention is only of minor importance for the reception of the work. Neither does the critique of the picture imply to simply take it down \u2013 thereby even censoring it for the public. If this is might be the first acknowledgment of criticism, then this approach towards artworks is not a sufficient examination of racism in the long run. Instead, however, a discourse on the social implications, in which such an image<del> can even <\/del>be understood as an adequate response to current social movements, has to take place. Unfortunately, the St\u00e4del Museum does not seem to understand this. And this is why any commentary that legitimizes the St\u00e4del\u2019s handling of this complex issue under the guise of artistic freedom fails to recognize the tragedy surrounding the lack of representation of BIPoC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour) in public, German institutions and discourses."},"id":"ab32a42c-971a-407c-a3fa-59f949ad8d36","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"For racism does not start with the killing of BIPoC in police hands and custody or when Nazis commit targeted attacks on migrant businesses in German cities. Racism also occurs when public institutions do not use their actual power to point out discrimination. The supposedly apolitical refusal to comment on social grievances is also an act of violence. With a slogan of the Black Lives Matter movement: \u201cTo be silent is to be taking the side of the oppressor!\u201d Now, to hop on the bandwagon of political correctness when the \u2018trend\u2019 demands it is already a sign of opportunism. Not even trying to understand the debate, but rather making an unreflected statement like Herold\u2019s image and refusing to criticize it, is sheer indifference towards the current socio-political struggles and the experiences of suffering BIPoC \u2013 not only in Germany but in our global society; no more than a white-saviour complex can be concluded from this behaviour."},"id":"f51abbdf-75b6-403a-b74a-17101010fa61","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"It does not require an art education or specialist training in order to realize that the behavior of the St\u00e4del Museum follows typical patterns in debates about racism on several levels and that the museum has obviously not understood what anti-racist action and thinking truly means. It is about listening to people affected by racism and taking their concerns seriously. Instead, white men in positions of power \u2013 be it at the top of museums or in the editorial offices of leading media \u2013 insist that the image is not racist but anti-racist \u2013 without seeing the contradiction. [2] It is a typical case of <em>whitesplaining:<\/em> white people with institutional power and cultural capital \u2013 but without experience of racism \u2013 explain to non-whites from above and from their white perspective how racism works. Thus, racialized people are denied the right to determine for themselves whether they are racially attacked."},"id":"5d0b7913-7b53-4c53-93f1-d88db5d0cce5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["features\/frei-von-diskurs-staedelmuseum\/web_new-fixed.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Men make up 88% of major US art museum collections.

The same applies to the N-word used in the title of the painting. If one looks at the expression in its historical context, it quickly becomes clear what the intention of its original use was. It is also significant that those in charge at the St\u00e4del Museum don't even consider that a white artist \u2013 whether consciously or unconsciously \u2013 could incorporate his racist socialization into his art. The fact that it would be appropriate to finally give non-white artists space and a voice in the artistic debate on racism does not seem to have occurred to them. In this specific case, the fact that substitute policy is pursued at St\u00e4del is particularly evident in the fact that the voice is not given to those who need it more urgently than ever and are generally under-represented in this institution: instead of letting BIPoC speak up about their experiences of violence, it puts forward precisely the one position that the St\u00e4del certainly does not lack of. [3] Since the museum\u2019s extremely extensive collection offers only limited diversity, it would also be a necessary step to internally oppose the prevailing ignorance and to reflect on why BIPoC artists and overall works of women are given nearly no space in the museum."},"id":"27569f6c-09bf-4c1f-a289-a8c2a87fb6d8","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"\u201cMuseums cement an art historical canon in their halls; not only is history displayed here, it is also actively replicated and produced. History is therefore also written in them. Writing this story entails ambivalent processes of ex- and inclusion, and the question always arises as to who exactly should tell, read or hear this story. You rarely reach everyone. With issues like racism and anti-racist efforts, however, this attempt should be clearly in the focus, because these affect and involve all of us in different ways and on a global level,\u201d states the artist Nicholas Grafia, who is continuously dealing with institutional critique and racism in the art world on his Instagram channel."},"id":"fbdc1a87-fb09-4b1c-8188-1e80a3395223","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"However, it is not only the lack of inclusion of BIPoC artists but also the lack of visibility in leading positions in cultural institutions, in the roles of curators and cultural journalists etc. This is where a phenomenon emerges in the field of art and culture, which is inherent in the capitalist form of society and can be applied to almost all areas of work: <em>gatekeeping<\/em>. Even those industries in which BIPoC are increasingly employed \u2013 in particular, and especially in the light of the current crisis, employment of female BIPoC in underpaid jobs in the social sector can be cited here \u2013 the traces of the gatekeepers can be found and are going to maintain with the existing systems if it cannot be overcome structurally. The term, which is used primarily in sociology to describe a situation in which people in positions of power influence the educational and career paths, and thus the opportunities for achieving, of others, begins with the school system, in which mostly white teachers decide on the educational path of their pupils and it continues in their professional life. Although there may already be initiatives by individual institutions to generally ensure greater inclusiveness among employees by means of quotas, here too, only exceptions confirm the rule. And quotation should not be confused with real equality and equal opportunities."},"id":"3d50fcc0-2488-473a-9e92-1825a7872149","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"If we go back to Herold\u2019s painting and look at it without the accompanying text of the museum, we see nothing more than a lynching mob attacking the supposedly <em>other<\/em>. It is an outrageousness that is only surpassed by the insolence that the descriptive text does not take a clearly anti-racist stance at all but lingers in nebulous pictorial interpretations. The re-traumatisation that this must entail for BIPoC can be deduced from studies in recent years dealing with race-based traumatic stress. [4] The violence against BIPoC is so present and happens on a daily basis, there is no need to be taken up in such painting, especially if created by those who are not affected by this unfortunate experience of violence. In many cases, such images can even lead to post-traumatic stress disorders, so that the artistic reappraisal of these violent experiences should at least lie with the people affected. Otherwise, it is merely an instrumentalized aestheticization of this violence against BIPoC. On a different note, the historical context in which Herold created this painting should not be forgotten here as both the N-word and precisely this violence against BIPoC were still perfectly acceptable in 1981. Today, it is impossible to argue about a progressive provocation of the viewer through confrontation with the motif without being extremely thoughtless in regard to the violation of those who are still affected by racist violence today. For white viewers, it is hard to understand the effect this picture has on people affected by racism. Perhaps this is why most of the German newspaper articles and the text written by the St\u00e4del appeal to the presumed strength that it takes to endure such an image. They, the white viewers, are never confronted, either real or fictitious, with the gesture that extinguishes one\u2019s very existence, which is so brutally expressed in Herold\u2019s painting."},"id":"e7f50aff-9d25-4793-adba-1068a950d918","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Moreover, there is no authentic understanding of art and society if only white artists continue to be exhibited and BIPoC artists are only asked to speak when their role as victims of racist violence is directly at stake; they are thus only subjected to an institutionally guided instrumentalization and are not respected with regard to the importance of their own oeuvre. The collection of the St\u00e4del, like many other art institutions, doesn\u2019t include the work of BIPoC artists in its understanding of art history. However, a collection that strives to show modern and contemporary art, but only exhibits works by white, mostly male artists, does not give an authentic picture of the world. It only provides information from the standpoint of the white privilege and reproduces the perspective of the supposedly white supremacy. Again, it must be emphasized that the St\u00e4del is not an isolated case when it comes to institutionalized racism. The voices that rise up against this specific kind of supposed reappraisal do not sound here for the first time. One could mention, for instance, the debate about Dana Schutz\u2019s painting <em>Open Casket <\/em>(2016), which was shown at the Whitney Biennial 2017 in New York and caused a far-reaching shit storm. [5] But the example does not have to be sought in the USA, because in Germany, too, one does not have to search long to find cases of appropriation and misguided debates. Most recently, for example, the collective <em>Soup Du Jour <\/em>set off a discussion in Berlin when it justifiably criticized K\u00fcnstlerhaus Bethanien for not including a single Black artist in an exhibition on Afrofuturism. [6] Last year, many people in Frankfurt also experienced great displeasure and outcry over several exhibitions. The retrospective on Wilhelm Kuhnert at the Schirn Kunsthalle, <em>King of the Animals<\/em>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fr.de\/kultur\/kunst\/latentes-unbehagen-10952743.html\">failed to address German colonial history <\/a>and instead focused on an outdated romanticising image of the African continent, thus overshadowing a critical examination of the artworks and their history.

[8] After the article <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.contemporaryand.com\/de\/magazines\/playing-with-race\/\">Playing with Race<\/a> <\/em>appeared on Contemporary And, Atkinson commented on the blindness and lack of sensitivity of institutions and stated that they are \"institutions that never really want to see our bodies and our history outside the context of art and media trends. Institutions that either tacitly accept racist representations or even promote them under the disguise of supposedly progressive art in the name of tolerance and artistic freedom. As a response when criticizing such depictions, we then hear again and again the same bland justifications of press departments that insist on freedom of opinion, artistic freedom, or speak of an age of change and the visualization of historical contexts. It often feels like an endless loop of institutional racism and cultural imperialism, criticism of the former, justification and apology. Unfortunately, little changes structurally.

It would go too far to list and describe in detail all the examples of institutionalized racism in the cultural sector since they cannot be summarized in their entirety in a single text. Exactly this shows that the discourse must be understood as a continuous one that must be updated again and again. After all, the accusation of a single art space does not dissolve the deeply rooted social problem. The multitude of incidents nevertheless shows all the more clearly that this discourse does not need to look for a single scapegoat. Instead, we must look at the constitution of the German institutions as a whole. However, it is essential to give space to the individual case studies and their vehemence and to treat the debate not only in a structural and abstract way.

It seems that the inherent feature of contemporary cultural institutions is that the absolution of art can also be imputed to themselves. Understanding a museum as a \"space for debate\" here does not mean opening it up to the demands and suggestions of the visitors. The label rather portrays the museum as a neutral space in which this debate could be fought out - the museum itself is even apolitical, one might think. Like science, also seemingly apolitical and objective. However, if you go back only a few centuries, you can see that it was science that contributed significantly to defining and shaping the concept of \"race\". Museums are accomplices in this development. By exhibiting and repeating stereotyped imagery, they shape viewing habits over generations. Just take the example of Orientalism, which in the 18th century convinced numerous Europeans that the entire Middle East was a \"land of plenty\", but where all men were lazy and all women were courtesans. Remnants of this standardized way of seeing can also be found in today's debate about refugees when so-called <em>Wutb\u00fcrger<\/em> (angry citizens) speak of economic migrants; and Indigenous people in North America are still associated with visual stereotypes from the colonial era.<br>"},"id":"f6373449-29fd-49d1-a4b6-703891c985d9","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"In addition, by neutralizing one's own attitude, one evades any possibility of acknowledging one's guilt. Without facing up your own history and structure, there can be no real process of coming to terms with it. Then we are left with Instagram activism and a self-staging disguised as debate. But museums in Europe are mostly white institutions with a difficult colonial past. Many are severely reluctant to come to terms with their own history, although the colonial history of the origins of many museums - paired with the problematic purchase of works in the context of the National Socialism - demands a special responsibility. A responsibility that they cannot escape. But what is currently happening follows a classic colonial-paternalistic pattern: Whites decide over the heads of BIPoC for their own benefit. It's also interesting how Martin Engler, director of the St\u00e4del Museum's Contemporary Art Collection, argues the justification of the Herold painting, not realizing at all what an essentialist structural reversal takes place here in the perception of the work. According to Engler, the discourse should get by: \"[...] without wanting to destroy the picture with the club or to take down everything that perhaps does not fit exactly into our society. [10] And this may be exactly the point at which the problematic aspect of the work has its roots and also in the context of which the presentation of the painting and the critical examination of it at least seemingly makes sense: it fits exactly into our society - because our society is racist. It systematically ignores and represses the voices of BIPoC. Instead of questioning one' s own position, one compulsively and defensively fishes for explanations. Perhaps the most cynical thing about Engler's statement is that he himself fits into society as a white man and decides that the criticism of racialized people is not part of it."},"id":"b001ff45-a141-4a68-b192-10ecc1a9a666","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"Furthermore, it would also be necessary to ask how the terms \"society\" and \"social debate\", as stated in the above-mentioned letter, are to be evaluated in the institution's understanding of these terms.

Instead, and this is particularly evident at present, it is this closure of actual spaces that forces critics to shift to social media, but with striking force. As a public educational institution, however, the St\u00e4del has a social responsibility, just as it has the influence and prestige to help shape social discourses. If this duty is to be fulfilled, not only the question of representation but also the question of accessibility, of the availability and the right of disposal over works of art, must be posed; likewise, the question of the agency, under whose aspect would need to be negotiated how works by artists are institutionally appropriated, for in many cases their effect and meaning are partly already cut back by the curators and mostly even, free of context, no longer allow any debate about them."},"id":"3103c0c7-47ce-475c-9517-09a6e510e22d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["features\/frei-von-diskurs-staedelmuseum\/web_tate-gallery-chalabi.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"A chart of all the artists in the Tate\u2019s permanent collection.

With our artistic positions? Where are we? The current constitution of the museums and cultural scene as a whole is a symbolic expression of precisely those power structures of colonial continuities that have always been there. When it concerns art, the question of the power of definition should also be asked. Instead, one observes the instrumentalization of BIPoC artists, who are given space as objects or tokens but never as subjects.
