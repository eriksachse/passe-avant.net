Title: Grayson Revoir's Tale of a Lonely Togetherness

----

Subtitle: Callus and The Crane

----

Place: Neuer Essener Kunstverein

----

Preview: Donald Barthelme’s short story *The Balloon* (1960) describes the short yet marvelous life of a gigantic balloon that one day took over Manhattan’s cluttered sky. Its presence triggered many different forms of engagement amongst the city’s habitants: some reacted as if the balloon has always been part of the environment, as if it’d finally taken its rightful place on a shiny throne on top of the clouds. Others used higher buildings to do everything in their power to jump on top of it, even throwing messages at it, hoping that they might one day receive an answer. Greyson Revoir’s exhibition ‘Callus and the Crane’ at Neuer Essener Kunstverein conducts itself in a similar manner to that striking lonesome balloon.

His form derives from a Tell, an artificial mound created by the accumulated remains of people living on the same site throughout successive periods of history. The principle of succession between the individual stratigraphic layers that make up a Tell is a key concept of modern scientific methodology in the fields of geology and archaeology. Following the trail of layers, researchers are able to trace the outlines of specific contexts representing moments in space and time and sometimes even manage to pinpoint the exact moment when an object from past civilizations was created and subsequently returned to the earth. <em>Callus<\/em>\u2019s stories, however, recall different incidences and slowly start to reveal themselves. He gets more and more talkative as he allows his visitors to wonder around him, step on his sides and even climb on top of his big rough belly."},"id":"ce53a87f-4bec-4cf4-bc63-741ad1f1c400","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"The introduction of <em>Callus<\/em>\u2019s antagonist is short and simple.

Perhaps it wasn\u2019t even his intention to fly all that way across the sea just to sit on top of <em>Callus<\/em>. Maybe it was the wind under his wings that carried him that way and he just so happened to land on top of that particular rock. As time went by, <em>Callu<\/em>s and the <em>Crane <\/em>started talking to each other; about the sky, suns, moons, sweat and saliva, about the creation of religion, the evolution of logic and the curious act of heterosexual conduct."},"id":"45e9c939-4696-4cd7-b72d-029a8be6257f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_revoir_nek_026.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Grayson Revoir, 'Callus and the Crane', 2019, exhibition view, Neuer Essener Kunstverein.

The walls are almost transparent and allow the stories to spread across the room. There, a single painting is placed on top of the wall and depicts a group of orgy scenes. A unity, a choreographed and heteronymous whole, where the human body is tangled and its borders are veiled. The <em>Crane<\/em> used to drop by sometimes to have a closer look at that wondrous body mass tethered to the power of polyphony. <em>Callus<\/em> is now yelling, and the wooden framed structure across the room vibrates to the tone of his voice, allowing the sound to become visible, even if it\u2019s just for a brief moment."},"id":"c3efa747-0533-4b1d-8089-50f49b26fc1d","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_revoir_nek_011.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Grayson Revoir, 'Callus and the Crane', 2019, exhibition view, Neuer Essener Kunstverein.
