Preview: For Walter, who identified himself as mixed race, the questions surrounding identity was constantly being challenged by himself and others. Identity here is in an unfinished state between a self-attributed identity and an identity ascribed to one by others

They evoke associations of tropical landscapes or maybe an attempt of warming up clean and uncomfortable offices. Presented in the white cube of the museum, however, they seem rather out of place. Marcel Broodthaers\u2019s installation <em>L'Entr\u00e9e de l'exposition (Catalogue-Catalogus)<\/em> (1974) \u2013 as the title indicates \u2013 marks the threshold between the museum as institution and the temporary exhibition, which I\u2019m about to visit. The palm trees growing naturally in regions north and south of the equator differ from the symbolically charged palm trees which decorate the foyers of former colonial powers. Broodthaers\u2019s installation is not only an introduction to the retrospective of the Antigua-born artist Frank Walter, but also draws attention to the continuities of colonialism. It gives food for thought to consider these implications especially in the space of a museum."},"id":"8b2a6db3-9f27-45dc-b259-128c2d2d1afc","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_9_mmk_frank_walter_untitled.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Frank Walter, Untitled, undated, Courtesy: the Estate of Frank Walter; photograph: Axel Schneider","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"c5952650-f255-4767-85e1-dee414093241","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"text":"Frank Walter (Francis Archibald Wentworth Walter) was born in Liberta, Antigua, a Caribbean island in 1926. First colonized by the British Navy in 1632 before formally annexed as a British colony in 1667, Antigua\u2019s history is one of oppression. It was not until 1981 that Antigua and Bardua achieved full independence. At the age of 22, Walter became the first person of colour to manage the Antiguan Sugar Syndicate, an important economic sector in Antigua, built on slavery and exploitation. In the 1950s Walter travelled to Europe to educate himself on modern agricultural techniques as well as researching his family tree, which lead him to ancestors in Germany. Alongside his work in the plantation industry and his political engagement (he founded the Antiguan and Barduan National Democratic Party in 1986 and ran for prime minister), he created an astonishing amount of art, which is at the heart of Walter\u2019s retrospective at the MMK. In the exhibition, we see that Walter\u2019s search for origin, identity and family history are themes that reoccur in his artistic practice. Poems and endless diary entries tell the story of countless racist attacks, which Walter had to suffer in his lifetime."},"id":"9ea54843-6303-4565-973a-066ce89bfd60","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_1_mmk_frank_walter_untitled.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Frank Walter, Untitled, undated, Courtesy: the Estate of Frank Walter; photograph: Axel Schneider","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"140a5ab9-aeef-4ab6-b0bb-09907353f98f","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_1_mmk_installation_view.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"'Frank Walter: A Retrospective', 2020, installation view, Museum MMK f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt.

The variety in his practice is a testament to the artist\u2019s ability to capture and reflect on his experiences and surroundings in an honest and accessible manner while also experimenting with motifs, themes, colours and materials available to him. The postmodern architecture of the MMK encourages a non-linear path through the exhibition. Sometimes I find myself in a corridor surrounded by wooden sculptures, then admiring landscape paintings the size of a small postcard and finally I am standing in a room full of photographs documenting Carnival festivities in Antigua and Bardua. Between these stops, Walter\u2019s works are put into dialogue with pieces by other artists such as John Akomfrah, Khalik Allah, Kader Attia, Marcel Broodthaers, Julien Creuzet, Birgit Hein, Isaac Julien, Kapwani Kiwanga, Carolyn Lazard, Julia Phillips, Howardena Pindell and Rosemarie Trockel."},"id":"c84d9ec4-efe6-43f3-b1d4-37d275d5ead5","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_mmk_kapwani_matieres_premieres.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Kapwani Kiwanga, <em>Mati\u00e8res premi\u00e8res<\/em>, 2020, installation view, Museum MMK f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt.

The piece is both a reference and tribute to the highly influential sociologist and co-founder of cultural studies Stuart Hall, who argues that identity is \u2018an ever-unfinished conversation\u2019. Blending archival images with videos and sound recordings, Akomfrah interweaves the biography of Hall with his theories regarding questions about culture, power and identity. The first scene shows a Caribbean landscape, referencing Hall\u2019s birthplace Jamaica, before he moved to England. These serene, idyllic images of landscapes also reappear in Walter\u2019s colourful paintings."},"id":"d73a8efe-e7d9-4951-9ebc-e3291c781943","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_john_akomfrah_the_unfinished_conversation.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"John Akomfrah, <em>The Unfinished Conversation<\/em>, 2012, film still.

One of the highlights, however, is <em>Untitled<\/em> (<em>Self Portrait)<\/em> (undated), in which Walter depicts himself as a figure seen from behind, who seems to be in a state of thoughtful contemplation. The melancholic atmosphere conveys a sort of longing for something that is either long gone or anticipated to be gone. It evokes 19th-century German romantic paintings by artists like Caspar David Friedrich; works which Walter might have seen on his travels through Germany."},"id":"eb0aa5b2-dbec-4d7b-b04f-471d351af7e0","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"text":"For Walter, who identified himself as mixed race, the questions surrounding identity was constantly being challenged by himself and others. Identity here is in an unfinished state between a self-attributed identity and an identity ascribed to one by others. In a series of three similar portraits (<em>Untitled<\/em>, undated) the complexion of the portrayed is composed of patches in different shades from light to dark skin colours. In other works such as <em>Self-Portrait<\/em> (undated) Walter even depicts himself as white. This points to the complex relationship to his own identity and Blackness as someone who identifies as mixed race."},"id":"147a1ae6-14ee-4ecd-a0d9-934422a5f58f","isHidden":false,"type":"text"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_7_mmk_frank_walter_untitled_self-portrait.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"Frank Walter, <em>Untitled (Self Portrait)<\/em>, undated, Courtesy: the Estate of Frank Walter; photograph: Axel Schneider","link":"","ratio":"","crop":"false"},"id":"5c466fe0-c113-4ec2-96d5-829852e34971","isHidden":false,"type":"image"},{"content":{"location":"kirby","image":["web_4_mmk_frank_walter_installation_view.jpg"],"src":"","alt":"","caption":"'Frank Walter: A Retrospective', 2020, installation view, Museum MMK f\u00fcr Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt.

In a 12-minute video Pindell sits in front of the camera and describes experiences of racism and racialized violence.
