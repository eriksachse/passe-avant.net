  "description": "From 2016 to 2017 curator and writer Carina Bukuts and artist Sonia Knop have organised exhibitions in Frankfurt, Germany, and Tel-Aviv, Israel, and founded PASSE-AVANT as a platform for exhibition making, discourse and discussion. Soon, PASSE-AVANT developed further as a journalistic medium and is now an online magazine for contemporary art. With a focus on the Rhine-Main area and its jungle of exhibitions and initiatives, our aim is to pay attention to artistic practices and exhibitions that can easily be overlooked.",
